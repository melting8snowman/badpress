### Mockup of badpress service for complaints, yammer and bad reviews

Current status: most or services operational, 
however app does not run on heroku for reason I have not found out.
No errors, everything seems fine on heroku but cannot get it to show.
Admin activities to be implemented.

**Two user profiles:** registered user and admin

**Features:**

*A Registered user* can:
 * create bad review
 * delete/hide a review created by him/her
 * view other reviews
 * correlate to other reviews by clicking Like/Vote up -button
 * search for a specific company for reviews
 * see a list of all the reviews (s)he has written

*An Admin* can:
 * delete/hide insulting or abusive reviews
 * search for a specific company for reviews


Further development options: 
A company could respond to the bad press given to them, but that feature will not be included in this development phase.
