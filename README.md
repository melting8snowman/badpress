Status: all services operational

[badpress can be run at heroku](https://badpress.herokuapp.com/)

At heroku, the Admin functions can be tested with 
user "hangon" pwd "keksi"



**Features:**

**Two user profiles:** registered user and admin


*A Registered user* can:
 * create bad review
 * view other reviews
 * correlate to other reviews by clicking Like/Vote up -button
   as badpress is a raging app, a user can update as many likes/dislikes
   (s)he wants in order to calm down
 * search for a specific company for reviews
 * see a list of all the reviews (s)he has written

*An Admin* can:
 * see all rewiews with all details
 * delete/hide insulting or abusive reviews
 * search for all reviews of a company
 * see a list of all the reviews (s)he has written
 * operate all the functionalities that a normal user has available


Further development options: 
A company could respond to the bad press given to them, but that feature will not be included in this version of the app.
