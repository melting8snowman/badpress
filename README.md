### Mockup of badpress service for complaints, yammer and bad reviews

Current status: all services operational, 
potentially a single post (badpress) view might be added.
Also might add some visuality, but that is not a necessity.

[badpress can be run at heroku](https://badpress.herokuapp.com/)

At heroku, the Admin functions can be tested with 
user "hangon" pwd "keksi"

--

**Two user profiles:** registered user and admin

**Features:**

*A Registered user* can:
 * create bad review
 * view other reviews
 * correlate to other reviews by clicking Like/Vote up -button
 * search for a specific company for reviews
 * see a list of all the reviews (s)he has written

*An Admin* can:
 * delete/hide insulting or abusive reviews
 * search for a specific company for reviews
 * list all the reviews and see all data


Further development options: 
A company could respond to the bad press given to them, but that feature will not be included in this development phase.
